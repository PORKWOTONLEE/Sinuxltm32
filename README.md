# STM32-VsCode-Project-Template

This template can help you to migrate your projects which generally generate by Keil Or STM32CubeMx to GNU/ARM Toolchain/VSCode. I modified the Makefile that build By STM32CudeMX and finally got this template, My Chip is STM32F103VET.

You can edit the json below to get better coding experience:
- .vscode\launch.json
- .vscode\c_cpp_properties.json
- .vscode\tasks.json

You can install some extensions to get better file format support
- asm assembly
- linker script
